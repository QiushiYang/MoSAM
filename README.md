This repository is the official implementation of MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything for Videos with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection

## Getting Started

#### MoSAM Installation 

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install **the MoSAM version** of SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:
```
cd sam2
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Please see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) from the original SAM 2 repository for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

Install other requirements:
```
pip install matplotlib==3.7 tikzplotlib jpeg4py opencv-python lmdb pandas scipy loguru
```

#### SAM 2.1 Checkpoint Download

```
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

#### Main Inference
```
python scripts/main_inference.py 
```

### Input is Video File

```
python scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_video.mp4> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>
```

### Input is Frame Folder
```
# Only JPG images are supported
python scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_frame_directory> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>
```

## Acknowledgment

MoSAM is built on top of [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Meta FAIR. 

The comparisons and this website are also inspired by the concurrent works, [SAMURAI](https://yangchris11.github.io/samurai/) and [SAM2Long](https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long)

The VOT evaluation code is modifed from [VOT Toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit) by Luka ÄŒehovin Zajc.
